## 🌍 Why CivicEdge?

In many places, people see problems — traffic, waste, pollution — and even imagine solutions.  
But these thoughts often stay in their heads, unheard and unrealized.

**CivicEdge changes that.**  
It gives every citizen a voice, every idea a stage, and every complaint a path to resolution.
